        <p class="intro">
          MS Dhoni is a former Indian cricketer and one of the most successful
          captains in Indian cricket history. Known as "Captain Cool," he led
          the Indian cricket team to victory in major tournaments like the T20
          World Cup, Cricket World Cup, and Champions Trophy. Dhoni was admired
          for his calm demeanor, innovative batting, and exceptional
          wicketkeeping skills. He holds several records and is considered one
          of the greatest wicketkeeper-batsmen and finishers in the game. Dhoni
          retired from international cricket in 2020, leaving a lasting legacy
          as an inspirational leader and a beloved figure in Indian cricket.

                Dhoni made his ODI debut on the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05 but

                against Pakistan in his fifth match. Dhoni scored an unbeaten
                183 off 145 balls against Sri Lanka in 2005, helping India win
                the game. He ended the series with the highest run aggregate
                (346) and was awarded the Man of the Series. Dhoni overtook
                Ricky Ponting as the number one batsman in the ICC ODI Rankings.
                He was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC for his performances
                in 2006. Dhoni had a disappointing 2007 World Cup, with India
                crashing out in the group stage. He scored 91* against
                Bangladesh after India's early wickets fell. Dhoni was named
                vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa
                and England.
